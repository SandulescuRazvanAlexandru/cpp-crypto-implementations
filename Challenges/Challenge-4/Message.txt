The cyber security of connected vehicles is one of the biggest issues facing manufacturers today. Three significant trends have led to this position: Complexity. Complexity is the worst enemy of security, and yet the past few years have seen a rapid increase in the cyber complexity of vehicles, evidenced by: (i) a massive increase in lines of code in a vehicle - approximately 100 million currently, compared to around 8 million for an F-35 joint strike fighter; (ii) an increase in Electronic Computing Units to something around 100 currently in high-end vehicles, communicating on a multiplicity of networks; and (iii) a rise in heterogeneity of in-vehicle systems - these are now responsible for a massive range of critical and luxury features within vehicles. Connectivity. This complexity has been exposed to wireless networks through the development of wireless communication interfaces. These interfaces are a double-edged sword - by connecting the vehicle to the Internet of Things, they have led to dramatically extended functionality, but they have opened up the traditionally closed vehicular system, making vehicles a more accessible and more attractive target to adversaries. Content. Theft of personal information, leading to identity theft, is an attractive goal for cyber-criminals. Personal data is increasingly available in car networks as the cars themselves are more sophisticated, and smartphones and other devices are connected to them.
